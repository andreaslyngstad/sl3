ESME|Apache ESME (Enterprise Social Messaging Environment) is a secure and highly scalable microsharing and micromessaging platform that allows people to discover and meet one another and get controlled access to other sources of information, all in a business process context. You can hardly turn a web page these days without seeing a story that describes how people are using social networks, whether it is Twitter, Facebook or some other service to develop and build their personal communities. In business, we increasingly see blogs and wikis demonstrating utility in problem solving and communications but the real time nature of business process problem solving largely remains untouched by social networking tools. Existing services, while attractive do not scale well and have proven unreliable. This is unacceptable to business which must be 'Always On' and able to support people in their daily working lives. Such applications must therefore be scalable and reliable but also provide a lot more. When solving problems, how good might it be if a user was able to tap into the collective knowledge of her peers or surrounding groups of people with whom she might naturally network in the workplace setting? How much quicker and with greater precision might she be able to solve daily problems? What if there was a communications mechanism that takes the best of what services like Twitter offers and co-mingled that with readily recognizable business processes? That solution is Apache ESME.Categories: contentLanguages: ScalaPMC: Apache ESME

Xerces for Java XML Parser|Xerces-J is a high performance, fully compliant validating XML parser written in Java. It is a fully conforming XML Schema processor that includes a complete implementation of the Document Object Model Level 3 Core and Load/Save W3C Recommendations and provides a complete implementation of the XML Inclusions (XInclude) W3C Recommendation. It also provides support for OASIS XML Catalogs v1.1. Xerces 2.x introduced the Xerces Native Interface (XNI), a complete framework for building parser components and configurations that is extremely modular and easy to program. XNI is merely an internal set of interfaces. There is no need for an XML application programmer to learn XNI if they only intend to interface to the Xerces2 parser using standard interfaces like JAXP, DOM, and SAX. Xerces developers and application developers that need more power and flexibility than that provided by the standard interfaces should read and understand XNI. The latest version released, 2.11.0, expands on Xerces' experimental support for XML Schema 1.1 by providing implementations for the simplified complex type restriction rules (also known as subsumption), xs:override and a few other XML Schema 1.1 features. This release also introduces experimental support for XML Schema Component Designators (SCD).

Xerces for Perl XML Parser|XML::Xerces is the Perl API to the Apache project's Xerces XML parser. It is implemented using the Xerces C++ API, and it provides access to most of the C++ API from Perl. Because it is based on Xerces-C, XML::Xerces provides a validating XML parser that makes it easy to give your application the ability to read and write XML data. Classes are provided for parsing, generating, manipulating, and validating XML documents. XML::Xerces is faithful to the XML 1.0 and 1.1 recommendations and associated standards (DOM levels 1, 2, and 3, SAX 1 and 2, Namespaces, and W3C XML Schema). The parser provides high performance, modularity, and scalability, and provides full support for Unicode. XML::Xerces implements the vast majority of the Xerces-C API (if you notice any discrepancies please mail the list). The exception is some functions in the C++ API which either have better Perl counterparts (such as file I/O) or which manipulate internal C++ information that has no role in the Perl module. The majority of the API is created automatically using Simplified Wrapper Interface Generator (SWIG). However, care has been taken to make most method invocations natural to perl programmers, so a number of rough C++ edges have been smoothed over (See the Special Perl API Features section).Categories: xmlLanguages: PerlPMC: Apache Xerces

The idea is that you can take advantage of the richness and features of XML and XML Schema and have these features mapped as naturally as possible to the equivalent Java language and typing constructs. XMLBeans uses XML Schema to compile Java interfaces and classes that you can then use to access and modify XML instance data. Using XMLBeans is similar to using any other Java interface/class, you will see things like getFoo or setFoo just as you would expect when working with Java. While a major use of XMLBeans is to access your XML instance data with strongly typed Java classes there are also API's that allow you access to the full XML infoset (XMLBeans keeps XML Infoset fidelity) as well as to allow you to reflect into the XML schema itself through an XML Schema Object model. For more details on XMLBeans see the XMLBeans Wiki pages or the XMLBeans documentation (the Documentation tab on this website). What Makes XMLBeans Different There are at least two major things that make XMLBeans unique from other XML-Java binding options. 1. Full XML Schema support. XMLBeans fully supports XML Schema and the corresponding java classes provide constructs for all of the major functionality of XML Schema. This is critical since often times you do not have control over the features of XML Schema that you need to work with in Java. Also, XML Schema oriented applications can take full advantage of the power of XML Schema and not have to restrict themselvs to a subset. 2. Full XML Infoset fidelity.When unmarshalling an XML instance the full XML infoset is kept and is available to the developer. This is critical because because of the subset of XML that is not easily represented in java. For example, order of the elements or comments might be needed in a particular application. A major objective of XMLBeans has been to be applicable in all non-streaming (in memory) XML programming situations. You should be able to compile your XML Schema into a set of java classes and know that 1) you will be able to use XMLBeans for all of the schemas you encounter (even the warped ones) and 2) that you will be able to get to the XML at whatever level is necessary - and not have to resort to multple tools to do this. To accomplish this XMLBeans provides three major APIs: * XmlObject The java classes that are generated from an XML Schema are all derived from XmlObject. These provide strongly typed getters and setters for each of the elements within the defined XML. Complex types are in turn XmlObjects. For example getCustomer might return a CustomerType (which is an XmlObject). Simple types turn into simple getters and setters with the correct java type. For example getName might return a String. * XmlCursor From any XmlObject you can get an XmlCursor. This provides efficient, low level access to the XML Infoset. A cursor represents a position in the XML instance. You can move the cursor around the XML instance at any level of granularity you need from individual characters to Tokens. * SchemaType XMLBeans provides a full XML Schema object model that you can use to reflect on the underlying schema meta information. For example, you might want to generate a sample XML instance for an XML schema or perhaps find the enumerations for an element so that you can display them. All of this was built with performance in mind. Informal benchmarks and user feedback indicate that XMLBeans is extremely fast.Categories: xmlLanguages: JavaPMC: Apache XML Beans
